Hi! ^.^  

My name is Danbee (단비), which literally translated from Korean means "sweet rain". Many of my friends call me tauntaun, a nickname coined during my freshman year at MIT when I was part of the Musical Theater Guild's production of Star Wars Trilogy: Musical Edition. <br/>

I am part of the Intelligent Systems Lab, headquartered in London, UK at the Sainsbury-Wellcome Center for Neural Circuits and Behavior. We want to know how brains understand the world. When we look at things, like this cup of water, we know what to do with them. We can imagine picking them up, throwing them around, what they feel like, and what they sound like. As of right now, we do not know how to give this power to things that we make. We try to understand this power by looking into the animal brain while it plays around in interesting worlds. When things in the world change, animals are surprised and look like they are trying to explain what happened. After that, they move in a different way when they expect that the world may change. By looking into their brains before and after the animals change what they expect, we hope to learn more about the brain's power to understand worlds.<br/>

I spend a lot of time thinking about permaculture, anarchy, circus, and education. I love spending time in the wilderness, especially by the sea. I'm a member of the band <a href="http://www.scubaphone.org/">Scubaphone</a> and the capoeira group <a href="http://www.mestrechuvisco.com/site/">Mandingueiros dos Palmares, led by Mestre Chuvisco</a>. <br/>

If you would like to get in touch, please email me at danbee at alum dot mit dot edu.
