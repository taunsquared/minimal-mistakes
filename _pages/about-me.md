Hi! ^.^  

My name is Danbee (단비), which in Korean means (literally) "sweet rain" and (idiomatically) "the first rain after a drought". Many of my friends call me tauntaun, a nickname coined during my freshman year at MIT when I was part of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mtg/www/2005/FAL/ProdStaff.html">Musical Theater Guild's 2005 production of Star Wars Trilogy: Musical Edition</a>. <br/>

I spend a lot of time thinking about education, permaculture, circus, and humane living. I love being in the wilderness, especially in the mountains and by the sea. I believe art has an important role in organising and building knowledge, as a tool for helping experts across specialities collaborate and share insights. <br/>

I got hooked on the neuroscience of storytelling while co-writing and choreographing an original musical called <a href="https://hackpunttool.com/">Hack, Punt, Tool</a> (you can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/IPpqXyo4jhM">2017 production on YouTube</a>). As part of my doctoral research, I wrote and published a science fiction graphic novel called [*The First VIRS*](/VIRS) and created a set of [original "science songs"](/brainplay/2017-09-14-Pilot-Data-Aronauts-EP/). My dream future is to train and play as a musician, capoeirista, and [VIRS (vigilante intergalactic roustabout scholar)](/projects/2018/02/28/VIRS-principles/). <br/>

My [doctoral research](/open-lab-notebook/) with [Adam Kampff](http://www.kampff-lab.org) (Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behavior) developed a framework for precisely observing nervous systems in increasingly natural environments and contexts. Referred to as "field neuroscience", I developed this framework from traditional laboratory neuroscience using two strategies for balancing the controlled experiment approach with the ethological approach (a.k.a. the empirical method of observing freely behaving animals in their ecological niche, or "natural setting"): <br/>

1. increase the environments available to use in the lab with the controlled experiment approach; and <br/>
2. modify experimental designs to conduct them in "natural settings". <br/>

You can [**read the full-text of my doctoral thesis here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iqyfmj1rmcn083z/DanbeeKim_INDP2013_PhDThesis.pdf?dl=0). <br/>

I will continue to develop and teach Field Neuroscience with the UK-based company [NeuroGears](http://neurogears.org/about-us/), focusing on building collaborative projects that use storytelling and interactive experiences to help people apply scientific methods of understanding to their daily lives. <br/>
