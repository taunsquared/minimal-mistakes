Hi! ^.^  

My name is Danbee (단비), which literally translated from Korean means "sweet rain". Many of my friends call me tauntaun, a nickname coined during my freshman year at MIT when I was part of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mtg/www/2005/FAL/ProdStaff.html">Musical Theater Guild's production of Star Wars Trilogy: Musical Edition</a>. <br/>

I'm a PhD candidate in the 2013 cohort of the International Neuroscience Doctoral Programme, headquartered at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisboa, Portugal. I joined the Intelligent Systems lab in Sept 2013 and moved with the lab to the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour in London, UK in 2015. I'm interested in cuttlefish, history of neuroscience, and perceptual control theory. I build interactive art installations that collaborate with the public to measure human behavior and psychophysics. You can learn more at <a href="http://www.everymind.online">Every Mind Online</a>. <br/>

I spend a lot of time thinking about permaculture, anarchy, circus, and education. I love spending time in the wilderness, especially by the sea. I've co-written and choreographed an original musical called <a href="https://hackpunttool.com/">Hack, Punt, Tool</a> (you can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/IPpqXyo4jhM">2017 production on YouTube</a>). I train and play as a musician, capoeirista, and VIRS (vigilante intergalactic roustabout scholar). <br/>

I'm currently developing a theory and methodology for field neuroscience, which would complement laboratory neuroscience by verifying the ethological validity of behaviour studies and of humane research techniques. After I earn my PhD, I'm interested in developing an educational system which presents and practices traditional school curriculum – maths, biology, chemistry, geography, history, physics, and more – in the context of permaculture farming. <br/>

I enjoy creating interactive learning experiences, and I love working at the intersection of art, science, and activism. I think fostering each other’s creativity and curiosity is one of the most important and beautiful things we can do for one another. I also think it is so important for women to empower and inspire other women and girls to take on roles of influence, mediation, and mentorship. <br/>
