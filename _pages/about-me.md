Hi! ^.^  

My name is Danbee (단비), which in Korean means (literally) "sweet rain" and (idiomatically) "the first rain after a drought". Many of my friends call me tauntaun, a nickname coined during my freshman year at MIT when I was part of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mtg/www/2005/FAL/ProdStaff.html">Musical Theater Guild's production of Star Wars Trilogy: Musical Edition</a>. <br/>

I spend a lot of time thinking about permaculture, anarchy, circus, and education. I love being in the wilderness, especially in the mountains and by the sea. I've co-written and choreographed an original musical called <a href="https://hackpunttool.com/">Hack, Punt, Tool</a> (you can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/IPpqXyo4jhM">2017 production on YouTube</a>). I train and play as a musician, capoeirista, and [VIRS (vigilante intergalactic roustabout scholar)](/projects/2018/02/28/VIRS-principles/). <br/>

I'm currently a PhD candidate in the 2013 cohort of the International Neuroscience Doctoral Programme, headquartered at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisboa, Portugal. I joined the Intelligent Systems lab in Sept 2013 and moved with the lab to the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour in London, UK in 2015. <br/>

My [research](/open-lab-notebook/) focuses on cuttlefish, philosophy of science, perceptual control theory, and evolutionary cognition. In collaboration with [NeuroGears](http://neurogears.org/about-us/), I build interactive art installations that allow people to participate in neuroscience experiments "in situ" while also teaching the participants a bit about neuroscience and themselves. You can learn more at <a href="http://www.everymind.online">Every Mind Online</a>. <br/>

If you would like to get in touch, please email me at danbee at alum dot mit dot edu.
