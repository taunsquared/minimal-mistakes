A little flock of birds  
lives in a walking structure.

A little luck, sir, to bless this tree house  
doused in the joy and pain  
of living in a cage so full of good intentions,  
but, whatever counts to bounce this house back  
on its feet when it falls  
down.

Little bird that lives in a nest of ribs --  
do you know where to go when you want  
to be home?

Don't be alone.  

Little bird that lives in a nest of hips --  
why don't your lips sip a bit from the trickling river  
of rain?

Little bird that runs in the bottom of the house --  
when you press on the ground,  
can you hear the faraway sound  
of other treehouses?

Can you tell them where our is?
