Hi! ^.^; HAVE YOU RENDERED? <br/>

My name is Danbee (단비), which literally translated from Korean means "sweet rain". Many of my friends call me tauntaun - it's a doubling of a more accurate phoneticization of 단, coined during my freshman year at MIT when I was part of the Musical Theater Guild's production of Star Wars Trilogy: Musical Edition. <br/>

My home is with my cat Gracie and amongst the Cambridge/Boston area community: here's a map of some of my favorite spots. <br/>

I am a PhD candidate in the International Neuroscience Doctoral Programme, headquartered in Lisbon, Portugal. As part of the Intelligent Systems Lab, I study animal behavior comparatively across many species to better understand intelligence, intuition, and how to nurture healthy, happy brains. I do non-invasive behavioral studies under the constraint of using only procedures that we find acceptable to use on humans. I have worked with lab-reared rats and cuttlefish, and am working towards research tools and methodologies that enable behavioral neuroscience studies of free-moving animals raised in nurturing environments. <br/>

I also spend a lot of time thinking about cyborgs, anarchy, earthships, and multimodal learning via circus and theater. I love good old-fashioned yarns around a campfire after a day full of wilderness adventures. I'm a member of two bands, Scubaphone and Woven. I fell in love with capoeira while living in Lisbon and currently train with the Mandigueros dos Palmares in Boston. <br/>

I live by the rule that the surest way to any heart is through the stomach. All food is created equally euphoric, but eggplants and okra are my favorite veggies. <br/>

If you would like to get in touch, please email me at danbeekim at mit.edu.
