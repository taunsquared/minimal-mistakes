Since December 2016, I've been working with Daniel Osorio (Sussex University) and Kerry Perkins (Brighton Sea Life Center) to study cuttlefish in an aquarium setting. Our goal is to combine principles from marine husbandry, neuroscience, and citizen science to design a non-invasive study of intelligent behavior that engages both experts and the general public. 

Our first project together was an interactive science exhibit that prototypes a way to conduct neuroscientific explorations of human behaviour "in the wild". You can learn more by visiting the [Surprising Minds exhibit page](http://www.everymind.online/projects/surprising-minds/) on the [Every Mind Online](www.everymind.online) website.
