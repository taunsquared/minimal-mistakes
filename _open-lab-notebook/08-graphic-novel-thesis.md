## What do you mean, a graphic novel thesis?

As part of my PhD thesis in neuroscience, I am collaborating with 17 artists to create a [hard science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction) graphic novel, which tells the story of Asoka Morei, a teenager living 100 years in the future. After their home, a Green Haven, is destroyed, they embark on a journey to try to prevent a similar fate from befalling a mysterious group of people re-growing the decimated Amazon forest. 

The story has 7 chapters, 7 scientific diagrams, and 3 dream sequences, and I've divided the illustration work amongst these 17 incredibly smart, skilled, and generous humans not only so that we can finish in time for my thesis deadline, but also as a proof-of-concept for the benefits and impact of massive collaborations between artists and scientists. I've been documenting our collaborative process on [this github repository](https://github.com/taunsquared/graphic-novel-thesis), and will publish a methods section in my thesis that details the lessons learned and insights gained from coordinating such a huge project. All told, this graphic novel will consist of about a third of my final thesis document. 

You can find the [full story script here](https://github.com/taunsquared/graphic-novel-thesis), and the [in-progress illustrated pages here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zzu53m29wpf5kmb/AACT6f9HJElgurzSgnVGB5IMa?dl=0). 

## Why write a science fiction graphic novel as part of your thesis?

Humans have engaged in storytelling since the beginning of our history as a species, and every culture around the world has at its core a rich collection of myths, legends, fables, and fairy tales. To this day, we create and share stories around campfires, over shared meals, on stages and tabletops, and through books, radio, films, tv, and countless other formats. Stories help us remember and pass on complex information, gain perspective on difficult situations, and expand our capacity for empathy. [The nearly universal success of stories as effective tools for good communication, powerful connection, and deep insight lead many to suspect a deeply fundamental connection between storytelling and the evolution and development of human brains](https://github.com/taunsquared/graphic-novel-thesis/tree/master/Papers/NeuroscienceOfStorytelling). Humans are very social beings, and stories demonstrate enormous power when it comes to coordinating human ideas and actions. 

For instance, [the Golden Age of Science Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Science_Fiction), which popularized and legitimized science fiction as a serious genre of literature, has had an enormous influence on current research programmes and engineering goals. Many of the adults who currently work on space exploration, develop flying cars, study gene splicing, build robots, and research brain-computer interfaces grew up in a culture fascinated by the fictional stories of authors such as Issac Asimov, Arthur C. Clark, Ray Bradbury, and Phillip K Dick. The science fiction genre thus expands the toolkit of storytelling to include simulations of incredible futures as a way to grapple with the knowledge that there are things we don't even know we don't know, and to imagine how we might face it. 

How brains face the unknown and the unexpected has been the core motivation behind my PhD research and the research vision of my advisor, Adam Kampff. For the last 6 years, I've had the privilege of working with him and the amazing humans of the [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://www.kampff-lab.org/). Together we have developed a diverse range of tools and strategies to study how brains build expectations about how things "should" work (often called our "model of the world"), and how brains adapt when new information or experiences break our expectations. 

Studying reactions to the unexpected under traditional laboratory conditions can be quite challenging, given that laboratories were originally intended to be settings where one reduces and simplifies phenomena in order to examine them in greater detail and under tightly controlled conditions. This is not necessarily a useful strategy to apply to the study of how we deal with the unexpected. Communicating our findings can be even more challenging, as our insights often ride the boundary between science and philosophy, and our explanations tend to work best when prefaced with lengthy historical or experiential contextualization. 

Given these challenges, I knew that I needed something more compelling than the conventional formats for scientific communication - the current tensions and distrust between academic scientists, policy makers, and everyone else makes that clear. And a decade of teaching at a summer enrichment camp for children from a mix of socio-economic backgrounds has made me passionate about making cutting-edge science as accessible as possible to everyone. So I threatened to write a graphic novel of my thesis, and Adam called my (not quite) bluff. 

## Some final thoughts from Carl Sagan

"Real science is as amenable to exciting and engrossing fiction as fake science, and I think it is important to exploit every opportunity to convey scientific ideas in a civilization based upon science but somehow unable to communicate what science is about.

... 

The greatest human significance of science fiction may be as thought experiments, as attempts to minimize future shock, as contemplations of alternative destinies. This is part of the reason that science fiction has so wide an appeal among young people: It is they who will live in the future. No society on earth today is well adapted to the earth of 100 or 200 years from now (if we are wise enough or lucky enough to survive that long). We desperately need an exploration of alternative futures, both experimental and conceptual. 

...

In all the history of the world there has never before been a period in which so many significant changes have occurred in so short a span of time. Accommodation to change, the thoughtful pursuit of alternative futures, is the key to the survival of civilization and perhaps of humanity. Ours is also the time of the first generation that has grown up with science fiction. I know many young people who would, of course, be interested, but in no way astounded, were we to receive a message tomorrow from an extraterrestrial civilization. They have already accommodated to that future. I think it is not an exaggeration to say that, if we survive, science fiction will have made a vital contribution to the continuation and benign evolution of our civilization."
