**"April 7, 2066: Mae Jemison Memorial Arboretum"**

**"Orbiter population: 8,063"**

**"It was a day of hope and wonder."** 

**"The Space Consortium had just completed their third space farm, and the news feeds were drowning in videos of the glamorous ribbon-cutting event..."**

We see beautiful, important people draped in gorgeously fashionable and unspeakably expensive formal attire, made with synapic thread fabric programmed to fluidly change colours in response to the lights, the music, and their wearers' moods.

**"...of the Orbiter home pods that synchronised their velocities with the new arboretum..."**

In a viewing port of the Arboretum, we see a huge mass of gathered Orbiter home pods, floating in synchronised orbit next to the Arboretum.

**"...of delicate, mouth-watering hors d'oeuvres made from succulent crops grown at the two older space farms, in carefully filtered water and pristine soil..."**

**"...for the world was becoming too dirty, too extreme in its weather, to support industrial planetside farming..."**

**"...and many people, on this historic day, were starving..."**

**"São Paulo, Brazil"**

We see Majhee walking briskly through the crowded streets of São Paulo. Everyone is wearing what looks like light-weight full-body hazmat suits, flickering a bit as the synaptic thread, or SynTh in the material absorbs dangerous radiation in the air. All hoods are up, breathing masks and googles are on. The air is hazy with smog, the sky a smeared grey-blue, and the mid-morning sun pale. As Majhee passes shops and cafes, the daily news appears in hologram-like projections that occupy the ceilings or hover at standing-head-height. Other humans have tiny projections coming from subdermally implanted chips in their wrists, palms, ears, or foreheads; these projections surround their wrists, palms, ears, or face with a sphere of light, called their "bubble", which either sonify or visualise entertainment, memories, mental models, dreams, news, and scholarly publications. 

A lot of the news is about the new space arboretum, but most of the individual bubbles are focused on news about planetside climate disasters: 

**"...[the Colorado River has *dried up completely*](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-colorado-river-runs-dry-61427169/){:target="_blank"} and many are migrating east to escape the *severe drought*..."**

**"...aggressive *water-borne disease* has placed [most of northeast India under *quarantine*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1151007/){:target="_blank"}"**

**"...[*total evaporation* of the River Niger](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/05/river-niger-drying-fg-raises-alarm/){:target="_blank"} has led to *massive lootings* at yet another hydropower station..."**

**"...[*hundred times* more likely to be diagnosed](http://www.who.int/uv/faq/skincancer/en/index1.html){:target="_blank"} with illnesses caused by *sun radiation* than even just ten years ago..."**

We see Majhee walk past a large research facility, metal and glass architecture dully gleaming in the smoggy light, labeled "Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública". 

*translation: National Laboratory for Biosciences and Public Health*

The front of the research facility is teeming with protesters, who chant "Não sirva aos tiranos em órbita!" and "Educar crianças humanas, não máquinas corporativas!"

*translation: "Don't serve the tyrants in orbit!", "Educate human children, not corporate machines!"*

**"...fifth day of violent demonstrations at the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública protesting the public research institution's collaboration with Space Consortium..."**

Majhee sneaks into an alleyway to enter the research facility via a back door. 

**"...last week the space exploration conglomerate announced the first ever patent on a device made with synaptic thread technology, commonly known as SynTh..."**

Inside the research institute, we see a receptionist sitting behind a sealed glass window. Next to him is a decontamination chamber that all must pass thru in order to enter the research facility. 

**"...Space Consortium's actions have been publicly condemned by many researchers affiliated with the LNBSP, including Dr. Majhee Suh, who was the first to cultivate stable thread-worms capable of spinning SynTh..."**

*LNBSP = Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública*

Majhee: **"Mornin', Paulo!"**

Paulo: **"Majhee! How's your head?"**

Majhee takes off her hood and googles - she is pretty and youthful for her 37 years, if it weren't for the many lines of worry and grim determination on her face. She shakes out her hair, cropped short in a bowl pixie cut. Clearly having many troubling thoughts, she begins taking off her SynTh hazmat suit.  

Majhee: **"Not great, but I'll live..."**

Paulo: **"Did you go to the hospital?"**

Majhee: **"No, I can't afford it right now."**

Paulo: **"Doesn't the LNBSP give you health insurance?"**

Majhee: **"Yes, but I'm not covered for injuries that occur off the work site...and technically, I was outside the front gates when the oxygen tank hit me."**

Paulo: **"You're joking...what kinda messed up thinkin' is that??"**

Majhee removes her boots and steps into the decontamination chamber.

Majhee: **"Yeah, well...everyone's hungry...can't think when you're hungry."**

A floating digital page reads the following:

**"Open SynTh Exchange"**  
**" 'Applying Tesla’s Theory of Wireless Energy Transmission to SynTh textiles' "**  
**"Asked 2.5 years ago Active 7 months ago Viewed 40k times"**  
**"Just finished reading [Nikola Tesla: On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony and Transmission of Power](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/nt_on_ac.htm#TOC){:target="_blank"}, and I'm fascinated with the parallels I see between Tesla's experiments with wireless energy transmission and the 'synchronized SynTh textiles' effect. I'm keen to systematically replicate Tesla's apparatuses in SynTh circuitry and would love to discuss further with anyone interested in collaborating."**
**"Keywords: Tesla, synchronicity, textile interactions, replication work"**
**"Posted 11 Aug 2063 at 13:42 by QueenBee42"**

Majhee stands in her office, seemingly floating in the center of a giant transparent bacteria made of light. The light model of the bacteria is exquisitely detailed, and a section of the nucleoid is blown up for closer inspection. Majhee's fingers are raised in a well-practiced yet complicated gesture. Her face is darkened with barely contained rage. 

Off panel: **"...and if you just *give away* your research we'll *fail* our next audit and then we'll *never* get another grant!"*

Majhee: **"Márcia, are you seriously talking to me about audits right now?"**

We see Marcia Netto, Director of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, in Majhee's doorway, looking exasperated yet sheepish.

Marcia: **"Right, sorry...I'm *very* grateful that you've come in today, I know you're going through a lot, but we need to address this situation with Space Co before it *ruins* us!"*

Majhee: **"If by 'address this situation with Space Co', you mean 'end the exploitation of Earthers by Orbiters', then I'm 100% on board."**

Marcia: **"Majhee, I have no time for your political agenda today. I need you to focus on the science, not be a social justice warrior!"**

alt="Chapter 1, page 5" caption="Art by Matteo Farinella, Lettering by Danbee Kim." %}

Majhee angrily turns off the giant bacteria of light with an impatient gesture as she turns to Marcia, furious.

Majhee: **"Do you *really* believe science is done in a vacuum?? You're taking dirty money and everyone knows it!"** 

Marcia, immediately apologetic, hands up to ward off Majhee's anger.

Marcia: **"Majhee, right now, there are *no other sources* of funding. None."**

Majhee: **"What about the UN grants funding *my* lab??"**

Marcia: **"Fine, no other *easy* sources of *big* funding. I know what you'll say, that we're trading ethical integrity for easier paperwork, but I *cannot* get our sponsors to care."**

Majhee looks at Marcia miserably. 

Majhee: **"The woman who asked me to help her fight corruption in São Paulo with open science would have *made* our sponsors care."**

Marcia: **"I know, but...look, can we just go for a walk?"**

Majhee: **"I can't, I'm already late. See, Felix is coming to fetch his delinquent P.I.*"**

* *P.I. = Principle Investigator*

Felix, a scientist in Majhee's lab, appears at the doorway.

Felix: **"Hi, sorry to interrupt...can we get Majhee please? Lab meeting was supposed to start an hour ago..."**

Majhee: **"No no, my bad, we're wrapping up now. Marcia, I'll give you a call later."**

alt="Chapter 1, page 6" caption="Art by Matteo Farinella, Lettering by Danbee Kim." %}

Majhee, Felix, and other members of Majhee's research group sit or stand in a cluster at one end of their lab benches in an upper floor of the research institute. The wall nearest to them is a floor-to-ceiling window, showing the dusty sky-line of São Paulo. The sun sits in a reddish hazy sky, just past the midday zenith. 

The circle of researchers: **Felix Grael**, a pale but handsome man in his late 20s, raised in Rio de Janeiro by Swedish immigrants who have since returned to Europe, his face lined with fear and sadness, head in hands as his elbows rest on his knees; **Kai Oliveira**, a much older woman of Japanese-Portuguese descent, grey-haired and hook-nosed, stern-faced and sitting stiffly in her chair; **Beatriz Cavalcanti**, a tall woman in her 30s, a Brazilian of Italian descent, mouth set in a grim line even as her hands squeeze Felix's shoulders in a motherly, comforting gesture; **Breno Leite**, a dark, thin man in his early 30s, born and raised in the streets of São Paulo by his young Brazilian single mother, who worked every day of her life before falling ill in order to send her son to university; **Nova Jatobá**, a young graduate student in her mid-20s, descended from indiginous Brazilians from deeper inland, her plump face lined with exhaustion; **Iara Gracie**, another young grad student in her mid-20s, who was born into an [old Brazilian martial arts family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracie_family){:target="_blank"} but chose the life of a scientist instead; **Vec Barbosa**, a portly Brazilian man of West African descent in his 40s, hands resignedly folded over a substantial beer belly, face troubled and sad behind a rather bushy yet neatly-trimmed beard.

Beatriz: **"So...it's back?"**

Felix, defeated: **"Yes...they think it was the [liver transplant](https://skincancer.ucsf.edu/transplant-patients){:target="_blank"}...my father had one last year..."**

Beatriz, gently: **"Do you want to go home? The lab can cover your flight..."**

Felix: **"Are you sure?"**

Beatriz: **"Of course!"**

Vec, to Felix: **"And if your father's doctors want access to our tissue database, you just let me know."**

Felix: **"I don't know...I know my mom would really appreciate having me at home..."**

Suddenly Felix screws up his face with anger and frustration. 

Felix: **"But...we're so close, and so is Space Co--"**

Beatriz: **"Hey, family comes first, and that's ok."**

Felix: **"But Kai's hands--"**

Kai, arms folded, looking down at her lap with hard eyes.

Kai: **"Yes, my hands hurt, but we'll manage long enough for you to set up a splicing station in Sweden...you're my best student, and we won't be able to finish in time without you."**

Majhee: **"What do you mean, 'in time'?"**

Kai hands Majhee a letter covered in legal jargon. 

Kai: **"It was in our mail pile this morning..."**

Majhee: **"This is from Space Co? '...Due to the challenges arising from our pursuit of exclusive patents on derivatives of a previous collaboration, we write to inform you of a forthcoming publication embargo on all research concerning SynTh-spliced [photon-harvesting biofilms](https://cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/Organic-solar-cell-smashes-performance/96/web/2018/08){:target="_blank"}.' What??"**

Nova, looking shocked: **"Are they announcing another patent already??"**

Kai: **"Not today...supposedly they will in 3 weeks. I told you, they'll only wait long enough for the publicity cycle to make a big splash..."**

Majhee, angrily: **"Yeah, keep the momentum going while everyone is still pissing their pants over what to do."**

Iara: **"Well... not to be the voice of depressing reality, but they're not going to *stop* steamrolling over open access, so trying to outrun them to *every* application of SynTh isn't sustainable."**

Felix: **"So what's your alternative strategy?"**

Nova: **"I think we should go silent after publishing this biofilm paper and put everything we've got towards developing the SynTh-hybrid skin idea."**

Iara: **"I agree. No more low-hanging fruit. The past few sprints with Space Co were training. Now, we run the marathon."**

Bruno: **"You talk like we just need to crunch some numbers! We still have *no idea* how to spin the SynTh into a structure that can emerge into a superorganism... and we still haven't *really* talked about the ethical implications of creating it."**

Felix: **"We have some idea! We know at least 22 ways that *don't* work!"**

Majhee: **"Kai, Vec, Bea? What do you think?"**

Kai: **"I say we start straight away! Felix and I will review the latest thread-worm recipe together-- tonight!"**

Felix looks dazed already. 

Vec: **"I'll set up a [scrambled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambler){:target="_blank"} line to Sweden."**

Beatriz: **"I'll get Felix his flight."**

Majhee quirks an eyebrow.

Majhee: **"You all...are the *best* people I've ever worked with...*thank you*...for trusting me...for working on this project, in this city, right now..."*

We see now the protesters outside, their desperate, hungry faces. They hold signs and wave flags with slogans like "Não sirva aos tiranos em órbita!", "Educar crianças humanas, não máquinas corporativas!", and "Alimentar humanos não foguetes!" 

*translation: "Do not serve tyrants in orbit!", "Educate human children, not coporate machines!", "Feed humans not rockets!"*

Majhee: **"And if anyone else needs to leave...I promise to get you and your family safely out of São Paulo and off Space Co's radar."**

**"6 months later: Massachusetts, USA"**

We see rolling countryside, vibrant with autumn colors, behind a low row of concrete warehouses, labeled "Morei Textiles". 

Off-panel, secretary: **"Hey boss, the folks from the World Health Organization are here."**

Off-panel, Iúna: **"Thanks, I'll be with them in a minute."**

We see the inside of a warehouse, where long rows of industrial looms weave SynTh textiles. Their combined activity generates a gently deafening **"WHIRRRRR"**. Iúna Morei, a tall shapely American woman of Portuguese descent in her early 30s, lustrous wavy brown hair pulled up into a bun, an infant with thick black hair strapped to her front, walks briskly and confidently away from a door labeled "Quiet Room" towards a group of humans waiting near the main entrance of the warehouse. 

Iúna smiles and yells as she waves towards her office door, just next to the entrance to the warehouse and labeled "Iúna Morei, CEO of Morei Textiles".

Iúna: **"HELLO! SHALL WE STEP INTO MY OFFICE?"**

Woman leading the UN delegation: **"Hi, I'm Amelie Kauffman, and with me are Javier Fuentes-Conte and Esteban Maranon."**

Iúna: **"I'm Iúna*. Thanks for bringing the new protocols from São Paulo."**

* *pronounced "Aye-**oo**-nah"*

Dr. Kauffmann: **"You know, you'd get these updates a lot faster if you'd just get a body mod..."**

Iúna gives the delegation from the World Health Organization a kind smile. 

Iúna: **"Dr. Kauffmann, I must admit that I'm adamantly opposed to body mods and SynTh implants...I'm extremely grateful that you've taken the time to travel all this way from DC."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"It's alright, we were in Boston this morning anway...besides, I wanted to thank you in person. No one beats your [MERV* ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_efficiency_reporting_value){:target="_blank"}...I've got your organzas in every window of my house."**

* *MERV= Minimum efficiency reporting value*

Iúna: **"Just doing what we can. What's happening in Boston?"**

Under this dialogue is a view of Iúna's desk. We see sneak peek's of the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols visualized with light, a floating sphere controlled by a thick piece of SynTh canvas, stretched on a semi-circular frame that, when Iúna stands inside of it, places the canvas at about hip height, easy to reach while standing.

Dr. Kauffmann: **"They're preparing themselves for a huge wave of refugees."**

Iúna: **"Really? From where?"** 

Dr. Kauffmann: **"This morning, Los Angelos. A police raid turned into a huge fire that's spread halfway up the coast of California. It's so big it's getting blown over the mountains into Arizona..."**

Iúna: **"Damn. How many dead?"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Haven't had a chance to count yet. Thousands are homeless..."**

Iúna: **"How does a *police raid* start a *state-wide fire*??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Apparently the targets panicked and tried to destroy the evidence...and the suburbs are just *filled* with [plastic furniture, which are basically *solid* petroleum](https://youtu.be/aDNPhq5ggoE){:target="_blank"}, and it all just hit a flash point...I'm sorry...do you know anyone over there?"**

Iúna: **"Yes, I...I'm sorry, I need to make a call..."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Of course. We'll see ourselves out."**

Under this dialogue we see close-up views of the baby strapped to Iúna's front. The child is a little less than one year old. The strapping is an intricately folded piece of SynTh cloth that can amplify the baby's heartrate, breathing, and digestive sounds.

Iúna: **"*[Tahoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoe_National_Forest){:target="_blank"}, have you been able to contact [Joshua Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Tree_National_Park){:target="_blank"}?*"**

Iúna's Biononymous contact at Green Haven Tahoe: **"*Negative, Mama Bird.*"**

Iúna: **"*How is Tahoe?*"**

Tahoe: **"*Fire hasn't gotten further than [Fresno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California){:target="_blank"}, but we're getting ready to offer sanctuary.*"**

Iúna: **"*...was it...[Portzy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portiuncula){:target="_blank"}?*"**

Tahoe: **"*...no one else had a body mod, Mama Bird...*"**

Under this dialogue, we see Iúna, who is now outside, and her baby is no longer strapped to her chest. Instead, her face is covered in a thick veil and she wears what looks like a heavy, full-sleeved and full-length apron. SynTh circuits flash within the weave of both Iúna's veil and apron. She stands, facing west, arms flung out wide, back straight and tall, legs apart, boots planted firmly in the frosty grass. 

Iúna ponders for a moment, her face furrowed with grief and concentration.

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, I've changed my mind. I vote for registering as a religion.*"**

Tahoe: **"*...seriously?*"**

Iúna: **"*Yes. Portzy was right - once schools require head mods for every student, once every job requires body mods in order to be qualified...our children won't have any choice. They'll need body mods just to* survive."**

Tahoe: **"*But...doesn't that feel too much like a* cult??"**

Iúna: **"*That's why I intially voted against it. But Tahoe, do you know what that group in Brazil published last month?*"**

Tahoe: **"*What?*"**

Iúna: **"*The first successful splice of SynTh with living cells - SynTh *biofilm*!*"**

Tahoe: **"*...Sorry Mama Bird, I don't follow. Why should I care about biofilm?*"**

Iúna: **"*Remember the mechapet idea?* It's possible now!!"**

### Neuron Classification by Structure

-- Unipolar --  
[**Unipolar neurons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unipolar_neuron){:target="_blank"} have only one "neuronal process" (extension, branch, appendage) extending out of their cell body. Many primary sensory neurons, which are the first step in translating chemicals, light, or vibrations from the outside world into neural signals, are unipolar cells. In addition, [unipolar brush cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unipolar_brush_cell){:target="_blank"} have been found in the cerebellar cortex and cochlear nucleus (part of the brainstem).

-- Bipolar --  
[**Bipolar neurons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_neuron){:target="_blank"} have two long processes that extend from the soma (cell body). One process carries info away from the soma (called ["axon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon){:target="_blank"}), and the other carries info towards the soma (called ["dendrite"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite){:target="_blank"}). Many non-primary sensory neurons,which filter or amplify signals from primary sensory neurons, are bipolar neurons. Bipolar neurons are found in the [retina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina){:target="_blank"}, [olfactory epithelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_epithelium){:target="_blank"}, [vestibular nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_nerve){:target="_blank"}, and [spinal ganglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_root_ganglion){:target="_blank"}.

-- Pseudounipolar --  
Pseudounipolar neurons are a type of sensory neuron in the peripheral nervous system, whose somas are located within the [dorsal root ganglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_root_ganglion){:target="_blank"} of the spinal cord. These neurons have a single, long axon that splits into two branches: a "peripheral branch" which goes to the skin, joints, and muscles; and a "central branch" which goes to the spinal cord. Pseudounipolar neurons develop from bipolar neurons.

-- Multipolar --  
The soma of [**multipolar neurons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipolar_neuron){:target="_blank"} is surrounded by many small, branching dendrites, and one long axon. Multipolar neurons function as [motor neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron){:target="_blank"} and [interneurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interneuron){:target="_blank"}, and they are found mostly in the [cortex of the brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex){:target="_blank"}, [spinal cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord){:target="_blank"}, and [autonomic ganglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_ganglion){:target="_blank"}.

-- Anaxonic --  
[**Anaxonic neurons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxonic_neuron){:target="_blank"} have many processes extending out from their somas, but no axon can be differentiated from the dendrites purely based on structure. These neurons act as ["non-spiking" neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-spiking_neuron){:target="_blank"}, which use [graded potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_potential){:target="_blank"} (as opposed to "spiking neurons", which use [action potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential){:target="_blank"}) to effect the fidelity, strength, and lifetime of a neuronal signal. Anaxonic neurons can influence the electrical excitability of spiking neurons, and [almost all central nervous system neurons born in adulthood seem to be anaxonic](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/32373/elife-32373-v2.pdf#page=23){:target="_blank"}; however, these neurons are still very poorly understood. Anaxonic neurons have been found in the brain and [special sense organs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ar.22732){:target="_blank"} of vertebrates, and in the [central nervous system of invertebrates](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/aohc1988/52/Supplement/52_Supplement_139/_pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### Major Glial Cell Types

A.k.a. ["neuroglia" or "glial cells"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia){:target="_blank"}, these non-neuronal cells of the nervous system have **four main functions**: 
* surround neurons and hold them in place
* supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons 
* electrically insulate neurons from each other
* destroy germs and remove dead neurons

-- [Macroglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia#Macroglia){:target="_blank"} of the [Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system){:target="_blank"} --

[**Schwann cells**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwann_cell){:target="_blank"} provide [myelin sheaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin){:target="_blank"} (which make action potentials go faster and farther) to neurons in the PNS, eat germs, and clear cellular debris to help PNS neurons regrow. 

[**Satellite cells**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_glial_cell){:target="_blank"} surround neurons in [sensory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_root_ganglion){:target="_blank"}, [sympathetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_ganglion){:target="_blank"}, and [parasympathetic ganglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_ganglion){:target="_blank"}; are interconnected by [gap junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_junction){:target="_blank"}; and are highly sensitive to [inflammation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation){:target="_blank"} and pain. 

-- Macroglia of the [Central Nervous System (CNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system){:target="_blank"} -- 

[**Oligodendrocytes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligodendrocyte){:target="_blank"} coat the axons of neurons in the CNS with their cell membranes to form myelin sheaths; a single oligodendrocyte can serve up to 50 axons. 

[**Astrocytes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte){:target="_blank"} (or astroglia) are the most abundant macroglia in the CNS. They remove excess potassium ions (K+) from around neurons; link neurons to a blood supply while helping form the blood-brain barrier; recycle neurotransmitters released during synaptic transmission; and signal to each other using [glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter)){:target="_blank"}, [GABA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid){:target="_blank"}, and [adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP, a molecule used for energy by all living cells)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate){:target="_blank"}. 

[**Ependymal cells**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ependyma){:target="_blank"} (or ependymocytes) line the spinal cord and the [ventricular system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system){:target="_blank"} of the brain to create the [ependyma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ependyma){:target="_blank"}, a part of the [blood-CSF barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid_plexus#Blood%E2%80%93cerebrospinal_fluid_barrier){:target="_blank"}. They are involved in creating, secreting, and circulating [cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid){:target="_blank"}. 

-- Microglia -- 

[**Microglia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia){:target="_blank"} are much smaller than macroglia and can change shape in order to move around the entire nervous system. They multiply when the brain is damaged, and constantly sample their environment in order to direct [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system){:target="_blank"} responses to damage or danger in the nervous system.
