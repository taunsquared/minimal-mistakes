From February 2014 to February 2015, I worked in collaboration with the Marine Biology Lab at Woods Hole, USA, to study the behavior of cuttlefish, an invertebrate marine animal related to octopus and squid. The experiments I conducted there are a part of a series of experiments in the Intelligent Systems Lab that ask animals of different species (rats, cuttlefish, humans) to solve open-ended movement challenges. 

## Video introduction to the experimental setup:

In this experiment, cuttlefish must hunt for their food 4 days out of 7; their prey is a piece of shrimp at the end of an arduino-controlled skewer. We wanted to ask the following questions:

* Can cuttlefish hunt artificial prey? If so, how complex of an artificial prey can cuttlefish hunt?

* Does the cuttlefish display a reliable sequence of body patterns when it first notices the prey?

* Does the cuttlefish display a reliable sequence of body patterns when it catches its prey?

* What are the firing dynamics of cuttlefish tentacles?
