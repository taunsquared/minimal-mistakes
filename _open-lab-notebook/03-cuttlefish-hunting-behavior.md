{% include toc title="Cuttlefish Hunting Behavior" %}

From February 2014 to February 2015, I collaborated with the Marine Biology Lab at Woods Hole, USA, to study cuttlefish, an invertebrate marine animal related to octopus and squid, from the perspective of neuroscience. My primary goal was to learn about their behaviour, how to take care of them, and how to modify our lab's behaviour experiment setups for rats to work with cuttlefish. 

During this time, I learned a lot about arduinos and cameras and how to film sea creatures. I took care of cuttlefish in all stages of their life cycle and even developed unique relationships with individuals.

## Introduction 

{% include video id="3SStj5fYHjU" provider="youtube" %}

In this experiment, cuttlefish must hunt for their food 4 days out of 7; their prey is a piece of shrimp at the end of an arduino-controlled skewer. We wanted to ask the following questions:

* Can cuttlefish hunt artificial prey? If so, how complex of an artificial prey can cuttlefish hunt?

* Does the cuttlefish display a reliable sequence of body patterns when it first notices the prey?

* Does the cuttlefish display a reliable sequence of body patterns when it catches its prey?

* What are the firing dynamics of cuttlefish tentacles?
