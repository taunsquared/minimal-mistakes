## Annotations

**"Loading Universal Record..."**

**"Finished loading...'A Beginner's Guide to SynTh: Introduction'; [Classification: *Unclassified*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information#Typical_classification_levels){:target="_blank"}."**

**"Synaptic Thread, commonly called 'SynTh', is spun by the bacterial superorganism [Electrophoretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis){:target="_blank"} [Mycelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycelium){:target="_blank"} [Yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast){:target="_blank"}, commonly called 'thread-worms'.  When cultured with [lactic acid bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_bacteria){:target="_blank"}, thread worms can decompose the [silicon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide){:target="_blank"} found in most sand to produce thread-like mycelium structures called 'Raw SynTh'. As it is being spun, raw SynTh generates [spontaneous bursts of electrical activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_waves){:target="_blank"}, inducing its atoms to self-assemble into [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha){:target="_blank"}-like sections. These sections can then flexibly mimic the behaviours of a classical [electronic circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit){:target="_blank"}."**

**"The exact nature of this flexibility is described by the SynTh's 'grade', determined by the characteristics of the [septum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum){:target="_blank"} separating its hyphae cells. In 'higher' grades of SynTh, the septum are composed of very small [hexagons](https://www.quora.com/Geometry-Why-do-we-see-hexagons-in-nature-so-often){:target="_blank"} and have a greater density of pores, increasing the flow rate of [organelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle){:target="_blank"}, nutrients, and ions throughout the hyphae. These grades of 'flexible SynTh' or 'flexi-SynTh' can be reconfigured almost indefinitely; however, they require frequent feedings to maintain. In cheaper grades of SynTh, called 'static Synth', the septum are composed of larger hexagons and have fewer pores, which limits static SynTh's [reconfigurability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconfigurability){:target="_blank"} but also reduces its sand consumption..."**
