Majhee angrily turns off the giant bacteria of light with an impatient gesture as she turns to Marcia, furious.

Majhee: **"We work at the *biggest* research center in Brazil, and have *way* more privilege than most folks on the street, so if *we* can't stand up to unethical behaviour, who can??"**

Marcia: **"Majhee, if Space Co can't work with us, they'll just go to some other institute. We don't *actually* have any leverage."**

Majhee looks away miserably. 

Majhee: **"Well...if the sponsors want me out, *fine*. I'm not taking back *anything* I've said against Space Co."**

Marcia: **"To be honest, they can't seem to decide whether to hate you or love you. You're the youngest scientist in the world with *two* UN grants..."**

Majhee, dryly: **"Are you saying I have redeeming qualities in the eyes of our prestige- and money-hungry overlords?"**

Marcia, hissing: **"Majhee! The walls...ears--!"**

Felix, a scientist in Majhee's lab, appears at the doorway.

Felix: **"Hi, sorry to interrupt...can we get Majhee please? Lab meeting was supposed to start an hour ago..."**

Majhee: **"I know, I'm sorry, I'm coming. Marcia, I'll give you a call later."**
