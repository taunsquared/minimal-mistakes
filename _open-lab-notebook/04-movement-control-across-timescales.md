## Moving at different timescales

In this project, we want to probe the ability to adjust movements to fit into the different timescales. It's a familiar aspect of hip hop dance; skilled movement artists in many disciplines can rescale their movements with eery accuracy:

Re-scaling movements are also a fundamental skill in predator-prey interactions:

## So what are non-invasive ways to probe this ability?

To find out, we ran a short little study asking humans to adjust their movements to fit into different timescales. Participants were asked to move from point A to point B, using a movement of their choice, within 3 timescales: "normal", "slow", and "fast". The "normal" timescale was defined as 8 seconds, indicated by 5 beats of a metronome at 30bpm (beats per minute). The "slow" timescale was defined as 16 seconds, indicated by 5 beats of a metronome at 60bpm. The "fast" timescale was defined as 4 seconds, indicated by 5 beats of a metronome at 15bpm. Participants were told that their goal is to make their movements as identical as possible across all three timescales.

## Dataset 

Using the software <a href="https://bitbucket.org/horizongir/bonsai">Bonsai</a>, the image of the moving participant was extracted from the videos of all three timescales and color-coded. The playback speeds were then adjusted such that all three images moved for the same length of time. The three images were then super-imposed upon each other into one video.
