This page is my primary documentation of my thought processes related to my PhD work, currently clustered under the working title *'An evolutionary cognition approach for studying general principles of intelligent behaviour'*

In my research, I want to know how brains understand the world, and how we are robust and flexible enough to deal with unexpected situations. My goals are: 

* to build a culture of collaboration, trust, and rigorous play in neuroscience; 

* to engage young people in questioning the status quo, both in and out of science; 

* to develop a theory and methodology for field neuroscience, which would complement laboratory neuroscience to verify the ethological validity of behaviour studies and of humane research techniques; and

* to connect how we study the brain to the experience of living with one.
