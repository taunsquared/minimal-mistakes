This page is my primary documentation of my thought processes related to my PhD work, currently clustered under the working title *'How the assumptions we make about brains affect our interactions and our societies'*.

In my research group, we study how nervous systems "in the wild" (as opposed to in the laboratory) are robust and flexible enough to deal with unexpected situations. Within this area, I study how we imagine and train for the unexpected. My goals are: 

* to build a culture of collaboration, trust, and rigorous play in neuroscience; 

* to engage with historical context and in questioning the status quo, both in and out of science; 

* to develop theories and methodologies for field neuroscience, which would complement laboratory neuroscience by verifying the ethological validity of behaviour studies and of humane research techniques; and

* to connect how we study the brain to the subjective experience of living with one.

## Want to help me create a graphic novel of my PhD thesis?

I am currently recruiting artists to help me produce a graphic novel, which will become part 1 of my written PhD thesis. If you are interested in collaborating, please [check out my flyer](http://www.danbeekim.org/call-for-artists-graphic-novel-thesis/) for more details on **PAID** illustrator, concept art, and technical scientific drawing gigs to contribute to my thesis!

## Videos

In this video, I draw and narrate an explanation of the research goals and interests of the Intelligent Systems lab using only the top "ten-hundred" words in English. 
{% include video provider="youtube" id="aDSavyoXqhk" %}

I was asked to describe on-camera the research we do at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour in this short video introduction. Filmed and edited by [Barry J Gibb](barryjamesgibb.com).    
{% include video provider="youtube" id="Hw2PpkREBVE" %}

I was interviewed for a series of short video documentaries about neuroscientists at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, Francis Crick Institute, and King's College. Produced by Jake Fairnie, Edward Bracey, and April Cashin-Garbutt.
