This page is my primary documentation of my thought processes related to my PhD work, currently clustered under the working title *'A vigilante intergalactic roustabout scholar (VIRS) approach to the evolutionary cognition of intelligent behaviour'*.

In my research, I want to study how nervous systems "in the wild" (as opposed to in the laboratory) are robust and flexible enough to deal with unexpected situations. My goals are: 

* to build a culture of collaboration, trust, and rigorous play in neuroscience; 

* to engage with historical context and in questioning the status quo, both in and out of science; 

* to develop theories and methodologies for field neuroscience, which would complement laboratory neuroscience by verifying the ethological validity of behaviour studies and of humane research techniques; and

* to connect how we study the brain to the subjective experience of living with one.
