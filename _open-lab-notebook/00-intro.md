This page is my primary documentation of my thought processes related to my PhD work, currently clustered under the title *'How can we get more brains to study brains?'*

In my research, I want to know how brains understand the world, and how we are robust and flexible enough to deal with unexpected situations. My goals are: 

* to build a culture of collaboration and transparency in neuroscience; 

* to engage young people in questioning the status quo, both in and out of science; 

* to develop a theoretical framework for testing hypotheses about the general principles of intelligence (as opposed to intelligence as specifically implemented by humans); and

* to establish a descriptive vocabulary for functions and aspects of the mind, in order to connect the activity of nervous cells to our life experiences.

## Writings
