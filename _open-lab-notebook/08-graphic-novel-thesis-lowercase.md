***“In 2067, the Global Water Crisis wiped out much of humanity, forcing survivors to flee underground or escape 
into orbit. 50 years later, teenager Asoka Morei lives in sheltered privilege at a Green Haven, far from 
the dark and over-crowded Underground Cities. But when Asoka’s Haven is attacked, they must journey into 
the Red Zone to find a mysterious people who may be re-growing the decimated Amazon Rainforest.”***

Hi everyone! My name is Danbee Kim, and I’m collaborating with [**17 amazing artists**](/VIRS/credits) to create ***The First VIRS*** 
([Vigilante Intergalactic Roustabout Scholar](http://www.danbeekim.org/projects/2018/02/28/VIRS-principles/)), a hard 
science fiction graphic novel that **combines my neuroscience PhD research with a speculation on how the next 100 years 
might play out,** given our current intellectual, environmental, and socio-political landscape. This novel will be 
included in my PhD thesis so that I can present my research in both the traditional expository format (background, 
methods, results, discussion) and [the visual narrative format, which is becoming an increasingly popular tool for 
science communication and education](
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322664468_The_potential_of_comics_in_science_communication). 

I'm communicating my research through a graphic novel because I want to **make science and technology topics more 
accessible to EVERYONE, from young people (and any other science-curious, comic-loving human!) to experts in other 
specialities.** I've developed the story plot with the help of my labmates, other research colleagues, science fiction 
writers, and countless friends, who all lent their enormous diversity of expertise to a project that we hope demonstrates 
the power of art to help experts across specialities collaborate and share insights. Once published, both the graphic 
novel and my full thesis will be made freely viewable online, and a downloadable pdf file will be available to anyone 
willing to fill out a questionnaire to help us assess the impact of presenting PhD-level research using the graphic novel 
format. 

We also want this graphic novel to **start conversations about what we define as "scientific activity", and how to build 
humane support structures to nurture such activity.** If you would like to get involved in these kinds of conversations, 
if you are passionate about making science and technology more accessible and engaging, and/or **if you would like to pre-order your printed copy of *The First VIRS*,** 

**[PLEASE JOIN OUR MAILING LIST!](http://eepurl.com/gkXmLP)** 

You'll get access to project updates and exclusive behind-the-scenes artwork, and you'll be the first to hear about our 
**crowdfunding campaign, coming soon!**

## What do you mean, a graphic novel thesis?

As part of my PhD thesis in neuroscience, 17 artists and I are creating a [hard science fiction](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction) graphic novel about of Asoka Morei, a teenager living 100 years in 
the future. After their home, a Green Haven, is destroyed, they embark on a journey to try to prevent a similar fate from 
befalling a mysterious group of people re-growing the decimated Amazon forest. 

The story has 7 chapters, 7 scientific diagrams, and 3 dream sequences, and I've divided the illustration work amongst 
these 17 incredibly smart, skilled, and generous humans so that we can finish in time for my thesis deadline. This 
project also makes a great case study for the benefits and impact of massive collaborations between artists and 
scientists. I've been documenting our collaborative process on [this github repository](
https://github.com/taunsquared/graphic-novel-thesis), and will publish a methods section in my thesis that details the 
lessons learned and insights gained from coordinating such a huge project. All told, this graphic novel will consist of 
about a third of my final thesis document. 

You can find the [full story script here](
https://github.com/taunsquared/graphic-novel-thesis/blob/master/ComicBookScript/2019-02-09_Script-Milestone2.md), and the 
[in-progress illustrated pages here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a6zzhwkvqngkuzz/AAAvoN1KMmM6ssf3imcDh-fma?dl=0). 

## Why write a science fiction graphic novel as part of your thesis?

Humans have engaged in storytelling since the beginning of our history as a species, and every culture around the world 
has at its core a rich collection of stories. To this day, we create and share stories in countless formats. 

Stories help us remember and pass on complex information, gain perspective on difficult situations, and expand our 
capacity for empathy. [The nearly universal success of stories as effective tools for good communication, powerful 
connection, and deep insight lead many to suspect a deeply fundamental connection between storytelling and the evolution 
and development of human brains](
https://github.com/taunsquared/graphic-novel-thesis/tree/master/Papers/NeuroscienceOfStorytelling). Humans are very 
social beings, and stories demonstrate enormous power when it comes to coordinating human ideas and actions. 

For instance, [the Golden Age of Science Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Science_Fiction) (1930s to 
1960s) has had an enormous influence on current research programmes and engineering goals. Many adults who currently work 
on space exploration, robotics, or brain-computer interfaces grew up in a culture fascinated by the fictional stories of 
authors like Issac Asimov and Arthur C. Clark. The science fiction genre thus expands the toolkit of storytelling to 
include simulations of incredible futures, as a way to grapple with the knowledge that there are things we don't even 
know we don't know, and to imagine how we might face it. 

How brains face the unknown and the unexpected has been the core motivation behind my PhD research and the research 
vision of my advisor, Dr. Adam Kampff. For the last 6 years, I've had the privilege of working with him and the amazing 
humans of the [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://www.kampff-lab.org/). Together we have developed a diverse range of tools 
and strategies to study how brains build expectations about how things "should" work (often called our "model of the 
world"), and how brains adapt when new information or experiences break our expectations. 

Studying reactions to the unexpected under traditional laboratory conditions can be quite challenging, given that 
laboratories were originally intended to be settings where one reduces and simplifies phenomena in order to examine them 
in greater detail and under tightly controlled conditions. This is not necessarily a useful strategy to apply to the 
study of how we deal with the unexpected. Communicating our findings can be even more challenging, as our insights often 
ride the boundary between science and philosophy, and our explanations tend to work best when prefaced with lengthy 
historical or experiential contextualization. 

Given these challenges, my advisor and I realised that our research needs a more compelling format than the conventional 
academic article - the current tensions and distrust between academic scientists, policy makers, and folks on the street 
makes that clear. Turns out, we weren't alone in our way of thinking! [Other PhD candidates have taken creative 
approaches to their thesis or dissertation to make their research more accessible](
https://helenkara.com/2016/07/13/getting-creative-with-your-thesis-or-dissertation/), and there is a growing interest in 
[using and understanding the potential of graphic novels, comics, and other forms of visual narrative "to engage 
audiences who are currently underserved by other channels of science communication."](
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322664468_The_potential_of_comics_in_science_communication)

So I threatened to write a graphic novel of my thesis, and Dr. Kampff called my (not quite) bluff. 

## But wait...what happened to your funding??

Last May I put together [this budget](
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-gb2VwRJqCN8jYjkmI91UCh0-Hw3A9GNJK9GyCLieU/edit?usp=sharing), and Dr. Adam 
Kampff, my advisor and group leader of the [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://www.kampff-lab.org/), approved me to use 
10,000 GBP of his lab funds to hire people to illustrate the graphic novel portion of my thesis. In academia, these kinds 
of budgets are often allocated autonomously by research group leaders, as the scientific merit of individual projects are 
often best known to the group leader. Thus, I made an [open call for artists](/call-for-artists-graphic-novel-thesis/) on 
Twitter, Facebook, on my personal website, and via mailing lists and online forums. By September 2018, with the 
administrative approval from the head of the lab secured, I hired an initial cohort of artists, based on submitted 
portfolios, artistic/scientific background, and face-to-face interviews, then contracted their work at a fixed rate based 
on standard industry rates. Excited to dive into the work of translating my story script and diagram descriptions into 
illustrations, my collaborators and I worked intensely to meet our first project deadline in December. 

When I began the process of trying to pay my artists, the administrative staff at our host institute suddenly became very 
concerned about my advisor's decision to support this project with his lab funds. On February 1, 2019, the directors of 
the institute stepped in to request a detailed justification of the use of Dr. Kampff's lab budget to fund this project, 
asking us to "Please understand that all of our expenses are subject to audit and we have a responsibility to make sure 
that our funders would consider any expenses valid." In addition, they told us that "given that risk that the expenses 
may not be justifiable, please advise the artists to stop any ongoing work." 

I immediately shared [the project's github repository](https://github.com/taunsquared/graphic-novel-thesis) where I had 
been writing the story script and documenting the project. I also linked the directors to [the dropbox folders containing 
all of the illustrated content created thus far](
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zi8mba9pitiy0pg/AABbcsxk666imF8FsFtxRtEia?dl=0), which was already a substantial portion of 
the complete work. I wrote a detailed justification for every item listed in the budget, explaining why I chose to work 
with so many artists, and how this unusually large collaboration required extra design work in order to coordinate visual 
elements across so many artistic styles. My advisor also spoke to them in person, hoping to make clear how this project 
fits into his research vision and my thesis work of developing diverse and innovative tools and strategies for studying 
minds. 

The directors came back to us with their verdict a few days later: 

> "In considering the justification you have provided, we have decided that:  
>   1. The funds for scientific illustrations used in your thesis and in any subsequent research publications are 
supportable (£480 in your recent budget request)
>   2. The graphic novel work and related character and dream sequence development is not research activity and thus is 
not a valid research expense and cannot be provided via Adam’s budget."

Given how much illustration work was already done (one artist had already completed all illustration and colouring work), 
and the rapidly approaching submission date for my PhD thesis, I tried to appeal the directors' decision. I asked 
University College of London, our institute's host university, for a letter of support. Helen Craig, a public engagement 
advisor whom I met when I was awarded a [UCL Train and Engage fellowship](
https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/projects/train-and-engage) last year, kindly wrote the following letter on behalf of the 
UCL Culture department: 

> "I have worked with Danbee supporting her projects, and I’m writing to express my own and UCL Culture’s support for 
public engagement projects such as her graphic novel thesis. I understand that this is a complex situation, but I hope I 
can set the policy context for the importance of public engagement within research.  
>   
> We see work like this as essential to achieving UCL’s core mission of transforming how knowledge is created and 
shared– and in enhancing the university’s impact on society.  
>   
> The new UCL Research Strategy for 2019 also highlights the importance of this area, with one of the three aims of the 
strategy being crossing boundaries to increase engagement between disciplines, communities and activities. Our own Public 
Engagement Strategy, accessible at [this link](
https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/sites/culture/files/ucl_public_engagement_strategy_2017.pdf), goes into more detail of our 
support for engagement as a team, and is strategy is supported by the principle theme of UCL 2034 - making UCL an 
accessible and publically engaged university.  
>   
> Wellcome themselves are keen supporters of public engagement, and have previously funded graphic novel and comic book 
projects through their own Public Engagement funds. Just last week they published a [blog post](
https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/weve-funded-projects-impact-and-legacy-latest-public-engagement-fund-awards) on their desire 
for a diverse and innovative public engagement practice. The Gatsby charitable foundation also believe that promoting 
public engagement with contemporary science plays an important part in ensuring that today’s scientific research has a 
healthy future.  
>   
> I know that the decision is in your hands, but I hope that this can inform your thinking around justification for the 
expenses. I’m happy to discuss anything in more detail.  
>   
> Many thanks for reading, and all my best  
> Helen"

Dr. Kampff also made a written statement of his view of the project in the following email: 

> "Hi All,  
>   
> I feel I should clarify my view. This project, as with all of the projects in my lab, have mixed both research and 
engagement components. For example, the lab (Danbee and Goncalo) developed a public science exhibit (now permanent) at 
the Brighton Sea Life centre, that was both a psycho-physics research experiment and an explanatory demonstration of how 
one's eye movements interrogate a complex scene and respond to unexpected events. As another example, we have spent years 
gathering validation data for advanced CMOS electrodes, and have invested extensive resources in sharing this data with 
the broader scientific and non-scientific community (e.g. there was event at SWC dedicated to exploring these datasets 
with professional musicians, as well as number of VR projects in collaboration with groups at Central St. Martins and the 
Bartlett).  
>   
> As you know, and as I discussed with [name redacted] on Friday, I have clearly understood my mandate as a group leader 
at the [institute name redacted] to pursue both neuroscience research and to explore new ways to do neuroscience 
research. With this understanding, I felt justified to pursuing these projects, many of which make up the bulk of 
Danbee's thesis. 
>    
> My personal view is that neuroscience has a unique, and largely untapped, potential relative to other domains of 
science. Unlike particle physics, for example, a lay person's knowledge about the brain, its role in one's own behaviour 
and the behaviour of others, is significant, as it is necessary for navigating the complexity of human society. Most of 
the research/engagement projects that my lab has pursued have focused on finding novel ways to "tap" this 
potential...both to aid neuroscience research, and to improve society.  
>   
> Both Danbee and I have been intrigued by the power of "a good story", and its impact on collective understanding in 
society, since the beginning of her PhD project. (...from why are (human) brains capable of such coordination? ...to what 
aspects of a story are most effective?). Given my (and Danbee's) interest in engaging the broad base of "lay expertise" 
in neuroscience research, it thus felt obvious to pursue this via an actual "story" that we could publish in a variety of 
formats and with a professional quality sufficient to attract a large audience (hence the need to recruit people who can 
actually draw).  
>   
> I hope this helps explain where I was coming from, and my goals for this project and Danbee's thesis. Thank you for 
highlighting the public engagement funding scheme; we are working on the application right now (but we would appreciate 
some clarification on the deadline for this current round of funding).  
>   
> I still feel that this project, like the others in my lab, represents a mix of research and engagement, and that it 
should be possible to support this with lab funds, although I recognize that this may not be the view of our funders. 
Towards clarifying their goals, Danbee had already contacted Helen Craig from UCL Culture, cc'ed, to offer the UCL 
perspective, and she has very kindly provided the attached letter. I would be very happy to contact both Wellcome and 
Gatsby to explain my views on this (and the other projects in my lab), if you think this could help justify the use of 
lab budget given the funders' goals.  
>   
> Please let me know how to proceed, and thanks for your time,  
> Adam"

After receiving these letters of support on February 5, 2019, the directors provided no official written response to Dr. Kampff's email for more than 3 months.

Thanks to the staunch support of Helen Craig and our institute's communications manager, the institute's Public Engagement Fund was able to grant us a generous award on February 22, 2019, which could cover part of the contractualized payments; however, we are still 5,960 GBP short of the amount necessary to pay the artists in full. 

Given the decision made by our host institution's directors, and with the encouragement of our colleagues, friends, and family, Dr. Kampff and I decided to ask our wider community of collaborators and supporters for help. **We will launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise the money necessary to pay our artist collaborators** the full amount that was stipulated by contract when they first signed onto the project - a reasonable and fair compensation for their time and skills.

If you would like to help us meet this goal, **please [JOIN OUR MAILING LIST](http://eepurl.com/gkXmLP)** to get updates 
on the crowdfunding campaign, and THANK YOU SO MUCH, from all of us working on *The First VIRS*!

## Some final thoughts from Carl Sagan

"Real science is as amenable to exciting and engrossing fiction as fake science, and I think it is important to exploit 
every opportunity to convey scientific ideas in a civilization based upon science but somehow unable to communicate what 
science is about.  
...  
In all the history of the world there has never before been a period in which so many significant changes have occurred 
in so short a span of time. Accommodation to change, the thoughtful pursuit of alternative futures, is the key to the 
survival of civilization and perhaps of humanity. Ours is also the time of the first generation that has grown up with 
science fiction. I know many young people who would, of course, be interested, but in no way astounded, were we to 
receive a message tomorrow from an extraterrestrial civilization. They have already accommodated to that future. I think 
it is not an exaggeration to say that, if we survive, science fiction will have made a vital contribution to the 
continuation and benign evolution of our civilization."
