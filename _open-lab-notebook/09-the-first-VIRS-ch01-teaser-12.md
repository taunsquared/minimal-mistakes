Kai looks down at her lap with hard eyes.

Kai: **"I'll manage long enough for you to set up a splicing station in Sweden...but you'll have to make it quick..."**

Kai hands Majhee a letter covered in legal jargon. 

Kai: **"*This* was in our mail pile this morning..."**

Majhee: **"From Space Co? '...challenges arising from our pursuit of exclusive patents ... we write to inform you of a forthcoming publication embargo on research concerning SynTh-spliced [photon-harvesting biofilms](https://cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/Organic-solar-cell-smashes-performance/96/web/2018/08)...*IN 6 WEEKS*'??"**

Nova: **"I'm *convinced* they're lurking in the OSE forums."**

*OSE = Open SynTh Exchange*

Kai: **"Well, outrunning Space Co to *every* application of SynTh was never a long-term sustainable plan..."**

Nova: **"Yes. The past sprints were training...now, we run the marathon!"**

Felix: **"And the *ethical implications*..."**

Breno: **"That hasn't stopped the *22 failed experiments* already published on the OSE..."**
