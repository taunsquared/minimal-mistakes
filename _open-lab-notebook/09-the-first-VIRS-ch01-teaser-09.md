## Annotations

Kai looks down at her lap with hard eyes.

Kai: **"I'll manage long enough for you to set up a splicing station in Sweden...but we'll need you to be quick..."**

Kai hands Majhee a letter covered in legal jargon. 

Kai: **"*This* was in our mail pile this morning..."**

Majhee: **"From Space Co? '...challenges arising from our pursuit of exclusive patents ... we write to inform you of a forthcoming publication embargo on research concerning SynTh-spliced [photon-harvesting biofilms](https://cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/Organic-solar-cell-smashes-performance/96/web/2018/08)...*IN 6 WEEKS*'??"**

Nova: **"I'm *convinced* they're lurking in the OSE forums."**

*OSE = Open SynTh Exchange*

Kai: **"Well, outrunning Space Co to *every* application of SynTh was never a long-term sustainable plan..."**

Nova: **"So what do we do?"**

Majhee, angrily: **"No more low-hanging fruit. We sprint to finish the biofilm paper...then I say we put everything we've got towards developing the SynTh-hybrid skin idea!"**

Nova: **"*Yes!!* Self-cleaning and self-mending fabric, here we come!"**

Iara: **"But Nova, so far we've only ever managed fabric that changes color and texture...and Breno's confirmed that Space Co's patent on SynTh batteries *cuts us out*. We need a different source of fuel."**

Felix: **"Bastards! They would've taken *at least* another 5 years without us or the OSE!"**

Breno: **"Lucky for us, *22 failed experiments* trying other sources of fuel are already up on the OSE..."**
