## Annotations

Dr. Kauffmann: **"They're prepping for a huge wave of refugees."**

Iúna: **"Really? From where?"** 

Dr. Kauffmann: **"This morning, Los Angelos. A police raid turned into a fire that's spread halfway up the coast of California. It's so big it's blowing over the mountains into Arizona..."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Apparently the targets panicked and tried to destroy the evidence...and the suburbs are just *filled* with [plastic furniture, which are basically *solid* petroleum](https://youtu.be/aDNPhq5ggoE), and it all just hit a flash point...I'm sorry...do you know anyone over there?"**

Iúna: **"Yes, I...I'm sorry, I need to make a call..."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Of course. We'll see ourselves out."**

Under this dialogue we see close-up views of the baby strapped to Iúna's front. The child is a little less than one year old. The strapping is an intricately folded piece of SynTh cloth that can amplify the baby's heartrate, breathing, and digestive sounds.
