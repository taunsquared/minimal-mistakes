This page is my primary documentation of my thought processes related to my PhD work, currently clustered under the title *'How can we get more brains to study brains?'*

In my research, I seek to understand how the intelligences of different animals are expressed as they navigate the complexities of their real-life environments. My goal is to design experiments that observe and analyze the behavior of freely moving animals as they are exposed to unexpected events. 

Key ideas that shape my research pursuits include: 

* **Movement is thought**: Movement is fundamental to the workings of the brain. It is clear from an evolutionary perspective that nervous systems developed as a tool for navigating unknown, complex environments. In turn, nervous systems adapt and change in response to the environments with which they interact, including the bodies through which this interaction is implemented; thus, cognition emerges from the interplay between brains, bodies, and the world. Taking all three into account is essential to understanding movement and thought, but this is often difficult, and such difficulties have created a trend to ignore this fundamental relationship. 

* **Empathetic animal research**: Neuroscience research has made us increasingly aware of both the influence of the environment on the brain, and the intimate similarities between human nervous systems and the nervous systems of other animals. The basic fundaments of biology also tell us that all living things are made from the same alphabet of five letters (A, T, G, C, U). We are starting to find that even in invertebrate animals exist abilities and processes that we once thought were only possible with a vertebrate nervous system. I want to engender and practice deep respect for all living systems in my pursuit of greater understanding. As a starting point, I do not use any research methodology that we do not currently find ethical to use in humans. I am constanly seeking collaborations to develop tools and methodologies that enable scientifically powerful observations of freely moving animals living in nurturing habitats. 

* **Holistic and non-fatalistic approach**: "Nature vs. Nurture" is a false dichotomy that does not acknowledge the brain's ability to modify itself. Reductionism can be a powerful tool for understanding mechanistic details, but it alone cannot do justice to the study of emergent properties, nor to connecting patterns of neural activity to natural behaviors at the organismal level. Neural activity is itself dynamic, responsive, and adaptive to the conditions in which it occurs. Brains exist within bodies and cannot be fully understood in disembodies contexts. These ideas not only describe the primary subject of my studies, but also my primary tool of investigation. I seek to design my experimental approaches for embracing the full richness of the brain across spatial levels and timescales. I also seek to nurture and hone my own brain by cultivating both my physiological and psychological awareness and fitness. 

* **Open and cooperative research**: Discussion and collaboration are essential for investigating complex scientific questions. Researchers need safe spaces to make mistakes, report negative results, try radical new approaches, and pursue questions challenging the status quo. Transparent and universally accessible research motivates more meticulous documentation, greater trust between professional science and the general public, and increased cross-pollination of ideas and advances between fields. I seek to support an open science community by using open source technologies and publishing platforms, and by building bridges between science, engineering, humanities, and the arts. 

I'm always open to discussing and improving my understanding and implementation of these ideas. 

Below is documentation of my thesis work, in various stages of polish. More thoughts can be found in "BrainPlay" and "Idea Garden" sections of this website.
