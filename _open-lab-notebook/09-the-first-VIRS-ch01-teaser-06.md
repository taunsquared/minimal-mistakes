A floating digital page reads the following:

**"Open SynTh Exchange"**  
**" 'Applying Tesla’s Theory of Wireless Energy Transmission to SynTh textiles' "**  
**"Asked 2.5 years ago Active 7 months ago Viewed 40k times"**  
**"Just finished reading [Nikola Tesla: On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony and Transmission of Power](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/nt_on_ac.htm#TOC), and I'm fascinated with the parallels I see between Tesla's experiments with wireless energy transmission and the 'synchronized SynTh textiles' effect. I'm keen to systematically replicate Tesla's apparatuses in SynTh circuitry and would love to discuss further with anyone interested in collaborating."**
**"Keywords: Tesla, synchronicity, textile interactions, replication work"**

Majhee stands in her office, seemingly floating in the center of a giant transparent bacteria made of light. The light model of the bacteria is exquisitely detailed, and a section of the nucleoid is blown up for closer inspection. Majhee's fingers are raised in a well-practiced yet complicated gesture. Her face is darkened with barely contained rage. 

Off panel: **"...and you shouldn't even *be* here right now, not after that hit to the head last night! Majhee, could you at least *look* at me when I'm talking to you??"**

We see Marcia Netto, Director of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, in Majhee's doorway, looking exasperated. Majhee sullenly turns from her digital bubble. 

Marcia: **"My *point* is... our sponsors are just trying to make the best of our situation right now. I agree, Space Co has changed a *lot* in the last 12 years...but ending the collaboration now will *cripple* every lab in the building, including yours. At the end of the day, we *need* to stay on good terms with Space Co."**

Majhee: **"More than those protestors outside *need* clean air and affordable food?"**

Marcia loses her patience. 

Marcia: **"Majhee, we are *just* a research institute. How are we supposed to police the largest international corporation on *and* off the planet??"**
