Inside the research institute, we see a receptionist sitting behind a sealed glass window. Next to him is a decontamination chamber that all must pass thru in order to enter the research facility. 

**"...Space Co's actions have been publicly condemned by many researchers affiliated with the LNBSP, including Dr. Majhee Suh, who was the first to cultivate stable thread-worms capable of spinning SynTh..."**

*LNBSP = Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública*

Majhee: **"Mornin', Paulo!"**

Paulo: **"Majhee! How's your head??"**

Majhee takes off her hood and googles - she is pretty and youthful for her 37 years, if it weren't for the many lines of worry and grim determination on her face. She shakes out her hair, cropped short in a bowl pixie cut. Clearly having many troubling thoughts, she begins taking off her SynTh hazmat suit.  

Majhee: **"Not great, but I'll live..."**

Paulo: **"Did you go to the hospital?"**

Majhee: **"No, I can't afford it right now."**

Paulo: **"Doesn't the LNBSP give you health insurance?"**

Majhee: **"Yes, but I'm not covered for injuries that occur 'off the work site'...and technically, I was outside the front gates when the oxygen tank hit me."**

Paulo: **"You're joking...what kinda messed up thinkin' is that??"**

Majhee removes her boots and steps into the decontamination chamber.

Majhee: **"Yeah, well...everyone's hungry...can't think when you're hungry."**
