I've been trying to make my own graphics to explain some of the theoretical frameworks I'm developing, with the goal of eventually building a framework of general principles for nervous systems. Below are two "theoretical puzzle pieces" that I've drawn in order to help me explain the organization of my thoughts. 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/brainPlay/LevelsOfAbstractionInBiology.png" alt="How we organize our research, or Possible levels of abstraction in biology" caption="This graphic applies the idea of levels of abstraction (from computer science, math, and physics) to our understanding of structural levels in biology. I wanted to map out why neuroscience struggles so much to connect neural activity to natural behaviours, and so I thought it might be helpful to explicitly lay out what I imagine to be the levels of emergence between neurons and behaviour, which, in neuroscience, is most commonly defined and measured at the organismal level." %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/brainPlay/KnownsAndUnknowns.png" alt="Potential framework for understanding General Principles of Nervous Systems: why do we need brains?" caption="The idea for this chart came from the 2013 documentary about Donald Rumsfeld, called 'The Unknown Known'. Rumsfeld used these terms to refer to international security and the political definition of 'intelligence', but the multi-faceted use of the word 'intelligence' got me thinking about how these terms might apply to biological intelligent systems." %}

More thoughts on these graphics to come.
