I just read a paper from the Journal for Critical Education Policy Studies called <a href="http://www.jceps.com/wp-content/uploads/PDFs/04-2-08.pdf">*Hip-Hop and Critical Revolutionary Pedegogy: Blue Scholarship to Challenge 'The Miseducation of the Filipino'*</a>. 

The author, Michael Viola, gives historical context to the current socio-economic order by comparing the No Child Left Behind law with the Education Act of 1982 in the Phillippines, a country whose current educational system is mostly based on the structure set up by American teachers who came to the Phillippines in the early years of American colonization (1901-1935).
