let's connect it back to places real, the feel of dancin a beat we weave into a future ideal. remember how our hands create, our feet can take us places, and our minds are just a tool to believe in us (in us, in us, in us, in us) - our minds are just a tool to believe in us. 

you're right, we shouldn't hate, but when you say you want escape then we lose all the strength you could give to us, oh. 

when our minds began to shape, faced an unknown landscape full of fatal fruits, but we move cuz that's what living things do, so we lived, and we lived, but now can we just live?
