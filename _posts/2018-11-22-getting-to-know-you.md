## Getting to Know You: a primer for young minds

Look!
Over there!
Did you see that creature moving?
Wait!
It's stopped -- what could it be doing?
Oh no!
It's disappeared!
Where could it be hiding?
Ah -- an attack!
Or maybe, does it want to play?
I think, my dear,
I know what we have here --
It moves its body,
it wiggles its parts,
it makes deliberate noises,
it stops but then restarts!
I think, my dear,
what we have here,
is a mind!

It's a MIND!!
