## Poems for my best friend's wedding

"Won't you celebrate with me"  
By Lucille Clifton

won't you celebrate with me  
what i have shaped into  
a kind of life? i had no model.  
born in babylon  
both nonwhite and woman  
what did i see to be except myself?  
i made it up  
here on this bridge between  
starshine and clay,  
my one hand holding tight  
my other hand; come celebrate  
with me that everyday  
something has tried to kill me  
and has failed.  

“Remember, woman”  
By Reese Leyva

Remember, Woman, you were born  
life giver, miracle creator, magic maker.  
You were born with the heart of a thousand mothers,  
open and fearless and sweet.  
You were born with the fire of Queens and conquerors,  
warrioress blood you bleed.  
You were born with the wisdom of sages and shamans,  
no wound can you not heal.  
You were born the teller of your own tale,  
before none should you kneel.  
You were born with an immeasurable soul  
reaching out past infinity.  
You were born to desire with passion, abandon,  
and to name your own destiny.  
Remember, Woman, remember  
you are more than you can see.  
Remember, Woman, remember  
you are loved endlessly.  
Remember, Woman, your power, and grace,  
the depth of your deep sea heart.  
Never forget you are Woman, divine,  
as you have been from the start.
